# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

# Team Roles
1. Project Manager:
- Oversees project timeline, budget, and resources.
- Ensures team collaboration and task prioritization.
2. Backend Developer:
- Designs and implements server-side logic, database integration, and API development.
- Focuses on data storage, retrieval, and security.
3. Frontend Developer:
- Builds user interface and user experience (UI/UX) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Ensures responsive design and seamless interaction with backend APIs.
4. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
- Tests application functionality, performance, and security.
- Identifies and reports bugs for resolution.
5. UX/UI Designer:
- Creates visually appealing and user-friendly interface designs.
- Enhances user experience through intuitive design elements.

# Technology Stack
- Node.js: for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- Django/Flask: for building robust backend systems.
- PostgreSQL: a relational database management system for storing and managing data.
- MongoDB: a NoSQL database for flexible data modeling.
- GraphQL: for flexible and efficient data querying.
- React.js: a JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.
- OAuth: for secure authentication and authorization.
- SSL/TLS: for encrypting data transmission.

# Database Design
1. User:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `name`
    - `email`
    - `password` (hashed for security)
3. Property:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `title`
    - `description`
    - `location`
    - `price`
5. Booking:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `property_id` (foreign key referencing Property)
    - `user_id` (foreign key referencing User)
    - `check_in_date`
    - `check_out_date`
6. Review:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `property_id` (foreign key referencing Property)
    - `user_id` (foreign key referencing User)
    - `rating`
    - `comment`
7. Payment:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `booking_id` (foreign key referencing Booking)
    - `amount`
    - `payment_method`
    - `payment_date`

- A User can have multiple Properties (one-to-many).
- A Property belongs to one User (many-to-one).
- A User can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many).
- A Booking belongs to one User and one Property (many-to-one).
- A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many).
- A Review belongs to one User and one Property (many-to-one).
- A Payment belongs to one Booking (many-to-one).

# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
    - Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Enables users to save preferences, view booking history, and track upcoming trips. Secure authentication and authorization ensure user data protection.
2. Property Management
    - Enables hosts to create, edit, and manage property listings, including details like description, pricing, and availability. Allows hosts to upload photos and specify property features. Helps hosts showcase their properties and attract potential guests.
3. Booking System
    - Enables users to search for properties based on location, dates, and other criteria. Allows users to book properties and receive confirmation. Integrates with payment processing to facilitate secure transactions.
4. Search and Filtering
    - Enables users to find properties based on specific criteria like location, price range, and amenities. Provides filters to narrow down search results. Helps users quickly find suitable properties.
5. Payment Processing
    - Integrates with payment gateways to facilitate secure transactions. Enables users to pay for bookings using various payment methods. Ensures timely payment processing and booking confirmation.
6. Review and Rating System
    - Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties and hosts. Provides feedback to hosts to improve their properties and services. Helps build trust within the community.
7. Security and Authentication
    - Implements secure authentication and authorization to protect user data. Ensures that sensitive information, like payment details, is encrypted and protected. Builds trust with users and hosts.

# API Security
- Authentication: this will ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.
- Authorization: this will control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- Rate limiting: this will prevent abuse and denial-of-service (dos) attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single ip address within a certain time frame.
- Data encryption: this will protect sensitive data, such as user information and payment details, from interception and unauthorized access.
- Secure password storage: passwords will be stored securely using a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Input validation and sanitization: this will prevent sql injection and cross-site scripting (xss) attacks by ensuring that user input is validated and sanitized before processing.

# CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process for software development. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures code changes are automatically built and tested, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates deployment to production.

CI/CD pipelines are important for this project because they:
- Improve code quality and reliability
- Reduce manual errors and increase efficiency
- Enable faster release cycles and deployment
- Provide immediate feedback on code changes

Tools that could be used for CI/CD pipelines include:
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Jenkins
- CircleCI
- GitLab CI/CD
